## Ingredients
### Dry Ingredients
- 344g All Purpose Flour
- 200g White Sugar
- 100g Brown Sugar
- 1 tsp Baking Powder
- 1 tsp Baking Soda
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1 tsp Cinnamon

### Wet Ingredients
- 160ml soy milk of your choice
- 3 Large Ripe Bananas (~360g)
- 1tsp egg substitute/flax egg
- 60ml Coconut Oil
- 3 Tbsp Lemon Juice (freshly squeezed)
- 2tsp Vanilla Extract

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Spray a 9×13 sheet pan with non-stick spray and set aside.
2. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and add the white and brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon and mix together.
3. Prepare the vegan buttermilk by placing 1 Tbsp of freshly squeezed lemon juice into a measuring jug and then adding soy milk up. Allow to sit for a minute to curdle.
4. Add the bananas, buttermilk and coconut oil to a blender jug and blend briefly until combined. Don’t overblend or the bananas will start to oxidize.
5. Pour the blended bananas and buttermilk over the dry ingredients and mix in.
6. Prepare your flax egg by mixing 1 Tbsp flaxseed meal with 3 Tbsp Hot Water and allowing to sit for a minute to become gloopy.
7. Add the egg substitute and vanilla extract and whisk with a hand whisk to remove any lumps.
8. Pour the batter out into the sheet pan and spread out evenly.
9. Place into the oven and bake for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
10. Place the whole sheet pan onto a cooling rack and leave to cool completely before frosting.
