## About Cake
We are a group of people in a dorm in Denmark, near the Danish Technical University (DTU), set on creating the best banan cake in the world. Over an extended period of time we have been baking cake after cake to achieve our goal, and oh we have come so close, but we are not quite there. 

No, _we need you!_. To craft the perfect banana cake, we must opensource the recipe and let the community cometogether to create this beautiful moist, marvelous and scrumptious sweet piece of deliciousness. So grap your keyboard... no... pot and pan... no that is not right either.. .. Bowl, whisker and measuring cups and let this banaventure begin. 


## Catagories
The banacakge is divided into two catagories: 
- *base* 
- *topping* 

The two will be scored seperately, but each is crucucial to achieve the best cake. The best banana cake must have the best topping and best base. We have submitted our recipe, you can use to build your variation from.  


## Scoring
We will not dicede which is the best bananacake, you will! We will just merge your _pull requests_, but otherwise let the community decide which is the greatest of them all. 
When you are scoring, be hounerable, banana cake is not to be taken lightly! There are simply too many calories for that. 


## Contributing 
1. [Fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
2. Bake a cake (totally the best part!)
3. Eat the cake (no wait, **this** is!) 
4. Write down your recipe. In the future we will have a terminal tool for this, but for now we will have a CSV file, where you will add your ingredients. We would like to use the metric system, but since it is easy to convert (and baking is a personal work of art and preferences) we allow you to use the imperial as well.. So go ahead and use cups! The computer will do the conversion anyways. Then add a file with a small presentation text e.g. "So good your tastebuds will set themselves on fire etc.." it does not have to be long. And most importantly a description of how you made it (this part is only relevant of you did something special or something you think is quite clever.. Don't be shy).

6. Let the world pass judgement and let your existence be enriched by the vast support the community.



# Tips
If you have old bananas, putting them in the freezer for suspended animation (suspended bananamation) will keep them alive long enough for you to utilize their cake potential.
